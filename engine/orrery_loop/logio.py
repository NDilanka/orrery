"""The ``.loop/`` state-file IO — the WRITER side of the Orrery loop protocol.

Pure file IO for the engine's side of ``orrery/PROTOCOL.md`` §1. The PARSE / match
logic for these files already lives in pure modules (:func:`orrery_loop.verdict.read_answer_inbox`,
:func:`orrery_loop.checkpoint.get_stop_mode`); this module only does the actual disk read / write /
delete.

- :func:`append_event`     — append ONE compact JSON line to ``log.jsonl`` (§1).
- :func:`write_checkpoint`  — write ``checkpoint.json`` (indent=2; the orrery just parses it).
- :func:`read_answer_inbox` / :func:`consume_answer` — read then delete ``answer.json``.
- :func:`read_stop_flag`    / :func:`clear_stop_flag` — read then delete the ``STOP`` flag.
- :func:`read_text` / :func:`write_text` — progress.md and friends.
- :func:`write_run_output`  — persist an agent call's raw stdout (``run-<n>.out`` and friends).

All paths accept ``str`` or ``os.PathLike``. Reads of a missing file return ``None``.

    ``index * 1000`` only when no line in the run carries one. Before this, no engine path
    ever wrote ``_t``, so LIVE runs always fell back to synthetic time. ``now_ms`` is the
    injected wall clock — seconds since the epoch, e.g. ``time.time`` (the codebase's usual
    clock-injection shape; see ``orrery_loop.supervise``'s ``clock`` param) — multiplied by 1000
    to produce the millisecond stamp. Callers that pre-stamp ``_t`` (e.g. replaying a
